This file is to help us keep track of dependencies such as packages that we are using or want to think about using.


Julia Packages
===
Things we could use
DataFrames - working with tabular data
DataStructures - sounds useful?
Gadfly - plotting library, goes well with IJulia
IJulia - julia kernel and magics for ipython

===
Things to look at
Argparse - parse command line arguments
Cartesian - fast multidimensional algorithms
Catalan - combinatorics library
Clustering - basic clustering functions (or we can write these from scratch to as learning process?)
DimensionalityReduction - PCA, ICA, NMF
Distributions - probability distributions and associated functions (sounds useful?)
DoubleDouble - extended precision (doubt we will need this, but putting here just so we remember)
Example - (to draw inspiration on how to structure our project)
GLM - generalized linear models (sounds useful)
LIBSVM - LIBSVM bindings for julia
Loess - local regression
MCMC - mcmc in julia
Memoize - @memoize macro (woot)
MLBase - functions to support development of ML algorithms (sounds useful?)
NHST - (doubt we'll need this, but putting here in case we do)
NLopt - calls NLopt library
Optim - optimization functions
ProgressMeter - progress meter for long-running computations
PTools - collection of utilities for parallel processing
Regression - algorithms for regression analysis
Resampling - tools for resampling data
SMTPClient - send emails (can use this to notify ourselves of when stuff is done so we can shutdown VMs?)
Stats - basic statistics library
SVM - svm


Python Packages
===
Things we could use
ipython - dependency for ijulia, let's us easily reproduce/share data exploration process+results
